# [AI6123] Time Series Analysis

### **====== I N T R O D U C T I O N ======**
**[AI6123] Time Series Analysis** is an elective course of Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence Graduate Programme **(MSAI)**, School of Computer Science and Engineering **(SCSE)**, Nanyang Technological University **(NTU)**, Singapore.Many of the complex systems are dynamic systems in which their states change over time. This course introduces time series models and the corresponding methods for data analysis and inference. Topics include **(regression models, autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), ARMA, and ARIMA processes, stationary and non- stationary processes, seasonal processes, identification of models, estimation of parameters, diagnostic checking of fitted models, rare event detection, forecasting, spectral analysis and time series models of heteroscedasticity)**. Real world applications for understanding characteristics, modelling and evaluating forecasts of time series data in economics, finance and industries are elaborated with lab on using R.

The projects of this course consist of **Three Projects.**

In addition, the generated output image and model checkpoints are not given in the file in order to save space since all the source code has been provided. Data are uploaded after all output folders are emptied.
